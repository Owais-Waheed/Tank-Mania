# Tank-Mania

It is a 2-player tank arcade game developed using C++ and SDL library with its Main Menu section written in C#. In this game, players try to capture opponenet's flag and then return to their bases without getting shot. We have utilized standard OOP practices such as classes, polymorphism, inheritance, operator overloading, function overriding and design patterns. It was a university project for the course OOP Design and Methodologies. Simple workflow of the game is given below:
